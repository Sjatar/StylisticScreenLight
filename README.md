This plugin for VNyan will shade your character based on a spout texture sent from for example OBS.

I have not found this plugin to affect performance on my system but this can be affected by framerates and texture sizes! 
I try my best to make my plugins efficent and this should run on low end systems.

------------------------------------------------

To install the plugin, simply extract all files in the release zip into: 
- Items/Assemblies

This is located where you have intalled VNyan.

------------------------------------------------

Make sure you have spout 2 plugin installed to OBS, I recommend and use: https://github.com/Off-World-Live/obs-spout2-plugin/

Make sure you have "Allow 3rd Party mods/Plugins" enabled in VNyan!

-----------------------------------------------

Open OBS! For this to work you need spout2 installed. If you have a game/display or window capture, right click it and add a Spout filter! In the example I added a browser source.

This plugin supports any spout name which can be changed through the plugin window. Default value is "screen".

This plugin comes with a custom window to set values in! It is recomended to use a node graph to set these values automatically. 
But the UI window makes it very easy to troubleshoot and test settings.

I will give a fast explanation of each setting.
- Effect on/off: turns the entire plugin on or off.
- High Light Strength: Affects the rim light effect.
- High Light X-offset: Positive values create a larger rim light on the top of the character.
- High Light Y-offset: Positive values create a larger rim light on the left side of the character.
- High Light Gaussian Quality: Affects the blur quality of the highlight.
- High Light Gaussian Iterations: Affects the number of iteration the blur is done. Higher value increases the size and quality.
- Base Light Strength: This affects the characters colour/light without the effect.
- Overlay Light Strength: Ontop of a rim light the entire character is shaded as well. This affects the strength of this light.
- Overlay Light Kawase Iterations: We use a kawase blur to blur the input texture. Higher iteration increases the blur amount.
- Brightness Threshold Filter: This prevents white lights from overpowering all other colour.
- Spout2 Source Name: The name of the spout2 texture input.
- Spout2 Source Width: The width of the input texture.
- Spout2 Source Height: The height of the input texture.
- Spout2 Source X Offset: The spout2 texture offset from the left of the OBS canvas. 
- Spout2 Source Y Offset: The spout2 texture offset from the bottom of the OBS canvas. 
- VNyan Source X Offset: OBS VNyan capture offset from the left of the OBS canvas.
- VNyan Source Y Offset: OBS VNyan capture offset from the bottom of the OBS canvas.

The current values of these settings can be viewed in the monitor if you search for ssl.

It is recomended that you setup a node graph that set these values when you start VNyan and also change them through a node graph if you change the scene.

Here is a example where all the settings are changed. I can provide a node graph example if anybody wants this.
